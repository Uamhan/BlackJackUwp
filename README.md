Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, is a comparing card game between the player and the dealer, the player competes against the dealer. It is played with a decks of 52 cards The objective of the game is to beat the dealer in one of the following ways:

#### Reach a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21 or
#### Let the dealer draw additional cards until their hand exceeds 21.

The player is dealt two cards, the dealer is also dealt two cards. The value of cards two through ten is their pip value (2 through 10). Face cards (Jack, Queen, and King) are all worth ten. Aces can be worth one or eleven. A hand's value is the sum of the card values. Players are allowed to draw additional cards to improve their hands.

Once the player has completed their hand, it is the dealerâ€™s turn the dealer will keep drawing to try and beat the players hand. Players win by not busting and having a total higher than the dealer, or not busting and having the dealer bust. If the player and dealer have the same total the dealer wins.
